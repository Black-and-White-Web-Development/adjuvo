# Adjuvo

An online tool to aid organisers of arts festivals belonging to the British and International Federation of Festivals in the running and management of their sections.

## Project objectives

### Data storage and analysis
1. Maintain a database for each Festival containing data on Adjudicators, Classes, Entrants, Trophies, Volunteers, and other relevant Festival data. Data should be stored in accordance with UK GDPR laws.
2. Maintain records of Class winners and Entrants who have received and returned Trophies.
3. Provide tools for Festival organisers to analyse Festival data and gain insights into Festival operations.
4. Generate reports on Festival performance, including entry trends, class participation, and resource allocation.

### Managing Festival entries
5. Allow Entrants to view, search for and enter classes using an online booking system.
6. Validate that an Entrant satisfies the Entry Requirements for a Class at the point of booking.
7. Provide a portal for Entrants to view their Class timetable and entry details.
8. Allow the Festival organisers to contact Entrants who have entered a Class.
9. Allow the Festival organisers to edit the entry details of an Entrant.

### Timetabling
10. Estimate how much time each Class should be allocated based on the number of Entrants, the time limit for each Entrant, and the allowing time for adjudication and changeover.
11. Allow Festival organisers to adjust the estimated time for each Class, while advising if the Class is likely to exceed the allotted time based on the conditions specified above.
12. Provide Festival organisers with an interactive timetable editor through which they may arrange the running order of Classes in a Section.
13. Generate a draft timetable for a Section, considering timetabling guidelines set by BIFF.
